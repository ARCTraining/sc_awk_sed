title: "Loops"
teaching: 40
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I perform the same actions on many different files?"
objectives:
- "Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files."
- "Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop."
- "Explain the difference between a variable's name and its value."
- "Explain why spaces and some punctuation characters shouldn't be used in file names."
- "Demonstrate how to see what commands have recently been executed."
- "Re-run recently executed commands without retyping them."
keypoints:
- "A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list."
- "Every `for` loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on."
- "Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). `${name}` can also be used."
- "Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as '*' or '?' in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion."
- "Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping."
- "Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them."
- "Use `Ctrl-R` to search through the previously entered commands."
- "Use `history` to display recent commands, and `!number` to repeat a command by number."

**Loops** are key to productivity improvements through automation as they allow us to execute
commands repetitively. Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the
amount of typing (and typing mistakes).
Suppose we have several hundred snapshots data files named `snap001.txt`, `snap002.txt`, and so on.
In this example,
we'll use the `high_equilibrium/snapshots` directory which only has one hundred example files,
but the principles can be applied to many many more files at once.

```{bash}
ls high_equilibrium/snapshots/
```

We would like to modify these files, but also save a version of the original files, naming the copies
`original-snap001.txt`, `original-snap002.txt`, and so on.
We can't use:

```
cp high_equilibrium/snapshots/*.txt high_equilibrium/snapshots/original-*.txt
```

because that would expand to:

```
cp high_equilibrium/snapshots/snap001.txt high_equilibrium/snapshots/snap002.txt ... high_equilibrium/snapshots/original-*.dat
```

This wouldn't back up our files, instead we get an error:


```{bash, error=TRUE}
cp high_equilibrium/snapshots/*.txt high_equilibrium/snapshots/original-*.txt
```

This problem arises when `cp` receives more than two inputs. When this happens, it
expects the last input to be a directory where it can copy all the files it was passed.
Since there is no directory named `high_equilibrium/snapshots/original-*.txt`,
we get an error.

Instead, we can use a **loop**
to do some operation once for each thing in a list.
Here's a simple example that displays the first three lines of each file in turn:

```{bash}
for filename in high_equilibrium/snapshots/snap001.txt high_equilibrium/snapshots/snap002.txt
do
  head -n 4 $filename
done
```

Note that it is common practice to indent the line(s) of code within a for loop.
The only purpose is to make the code easier to read -- it is not required for the loop to run.

When the shell sees the keyword `for`,
it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list.
Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to
the **variable**, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to 
the next item in the list.
Inside the loop,
we call for the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it.
The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat
the **variable** as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,
rather than treat it as text or an external command. 

In this example, the list is two filenames: `snap001.txt` and `snap002.txt`.
Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable `filename`
and run the `head` command.
The first time through the loop,
`$filename` is `snap001.txt`. 
The interpreter runs the command `head` on `snap001.txt`, 
and the prints the 
first three lines of `snap001.txt`.
For the second iteration, `$filename` becomes 
`snap002.txt`. This time, the shell runs `head` on `snap002.txt`
and prints the first three lines of `snap002.txt`. 
Since the list was only two items, the shell exits the `for` loop.

When using variables it is also
possible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable
name: `$filename` is equivalent to `${filename}`, but is different from
`${file}name`. You may find this notation in other people's programs.

Returning to our example in the `high_equilibrium/snapshots/` directory,
we have called the variable in this loop `filename`
in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;
if we wrote this loop as:


```bash
for x in snap001.txt snap002.txt
do
    head -n 4 $x
done
```

    Mass	x	y	z	vx	vy	vz
    M_sol	Parsecs	Parsecs	Parsecs	km/s	km/s	km/s
    
    0.11	1.15	0.6	1.3	-0.01	0.89	1.12
    Mass	x	y	z	vx	vy	vz
    M_sol	Parsecs	Parsecs	Parsecs	km/s	km/s	km/s
    
    0.11	1.14	0.68	1.41	-0.19	0.75	1.19


or


```bash
for temperature in snap001.txt snap002.txt
do
    head -n 4 $temperature
done
```

    Mass	x	y	z	vx	vy	vz
    M_sol	Parsecs	Parsecs	Parsecs	km/s	km/s	km/s
    
    0.11	1.15	0.6	1.3	-0.01	0.89	1.12
    Mass	x	y	z	vx	vy	vz
    M_sol	Parsecs	Parsecs	Parsecs	km/s	km/s	km/s
    
    0.11	1.14	0.68	1.41	-0.19	0.75	1.19


it would work exactly the same way.
*Don't do this.*
Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so meaningless names (like `x`) or misleading names (like `temperature`)
increase the odds that the program won't do what its readers think it does.

Let's continue with our example in the `high_equilibrium/snapshots/` directory.
Here's a slightly more complicated loop:


```bash
for filename in snap001.txt snap002.txt
do
    echo $filename
    head -n 4 $filename | tail -n 1
done
```

    snap001.txt
    0.11	1.15	0.6	1.3	-0.01	0.89	1.12
    snap002.txt
    0.11	1.14	0.68	1.41	-0.19	0.75	1.19


The **loop body**
then executes two commands for each of those files.
The first, `echo`, just prints its command-line arguments to standard output.

In this case,
since the shell expands `$filename` to be the name of a file,
`echo $filename` just prints the name of the file.
Note that we can't write this as:


```bash
for filename in snap001.txt snap002.txt
do
    $filename
    head -n 4 $filename | tail -n 1
done
```

    bash: snap001.txt: command not found
    0.11	1.15	0.6	1.3	-0.01	0.89	1.12
    bash: snap002.txt: command not found
    0.11	1.14	0.68	1.41	-0.19	0.75	1.19


because then the first time through the loop,
when `$filename` expanded to `snap001.txt`, the shell would try to run `snap001.txt` as a program.
Finally,
the `head` and `tail` combination selects line 4
from whatever file is being processed
(assuming the file has at least 4 lines).

Going back to our original file copying problem, we can solve it using this loop:


```bash
for filename in *.txt
do
    cp $filename original-$filename
done
```

This loop runs the `cp` command once for each filename.

Since the `cp` command does not normally produce any output, itâ€™s hard to check that the loop is doing the correct thing. By prefixing the command with `echo` it is possible to see each command as it would be executed.


```bash
for filename in *.txt
do
    echo "Copying $filename ..." && cp $filename original-$filename && echo "$filename copied sucessfully"
done
```

The `&&` operator separate items in a list of commands. The command after `&&` is executed if, and only if, the command before returns an exit status of zero. This ensure that if the command `cp` fail for any reason we see that information on our log. If you are expecting the first commnd to returns a non-zero exit status, you can use the `||` operator.

In our example, we named the new files as `original-$filename`. If we run the same loop, `for filename in *.txt`, again, we would end up with files `snap001.txt`, `original-snap001.txt`, `original-original-snap001.txt`, `snap002.txt`, `original-snap002.txt`, `original-original-snap002.txt`, and so on. We can use shell parameter expansion to avoid this. We are only going to see three expansions and we invite you to visit the [manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion) for more.

To trim the parameter we can use `${parameter:offset:length}`.


```bash
string=01234567890abcdefgh
echo ${string:7}
```

    7890abcdefgh



```bash
echo ${string:7:0}
```

    



```bash
echo ${string:7:2}
```

    78



```bash
echo ${string:7:-2}
```

    7890abcdef



```bash
echo ${string: -7}
```

    bcdefgh



```bash
echo ${string: -7:0}
```

    



```bash
echo ${string: -7:2}
```

    bc



```bash
echo ${string: -7:-2}
```

    bcdef


To replace part of the parameter, we can use `${parameter/pattern/string}`.


```bash
filename=snap001.txt
```


```bash
echo ${filename/snap/shot}
```

    shot001.txt



```bash
echo ${filename/.txt/.backup}
```

    snap001.backup


Replace part of the parameter is very handful when using commands that require the name of the input and output file and they have different extensions.

The third and last expansion that we are going to see is called, command substitution. Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself. Command substitution occurs when a command is enclosed as follows:

```
$(command)
```

Bash performs the expansion by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. Suppose that you keep a file call `snap2run.list` with a list of the files that you want to process.


```bash
cat snap2run.list
```

    snap001.txt
    snap002.txt


You can use the command substitution to get the names from that file.


```bash
for filename in $(cat snap2run.list)
do
    echo "Copying $filename ..." && cp $filename original-$filename && echo "$filename copied sucessfully"
done
```

    Copying snap001.txt ...
    snap001.txt copied sucessfully
    Copying snap002.txt ...
    snap002.txt copied sucessfully


In the previous example, we use `cat` but we could have used any other command.

Talking about conditionally processing or not one file, Bash has builtin conditional expressions.

Expressions may be unary or binary. Unary expressions are often used to examine the status of a file. There are string operators and numeric comparison operators as well. The full list of expressions is below.

- `-a file`: True if file exists.
- `-b file`: True if file exists and is a block special file.
- `-c file`: True if file exists and is a character special file.
- `-d file`: True if file exists and is a directory.
- `-e file`: True if file exists.
- `-f file`: True if file exists and is a regular file.
- `-g file`: True if file exists and its set-group-id bit is set.
- `-h file`: True if file exists and is a symbolic link.
- `-k file`: True if file exists and its "sticky" bit is set.
- `-p file`: True if file exists and is a named pipe (FIFO).
- `-r file`: True if file exists and is readable.
- `-s file`: True if file exists and has a size greater than zero.
- `-t fd`: True if file descriptor fd is open and refers to a terminal.
- `-u file`: True if file exists and its set-user-id bit is set.
- `-w file`: True if file exists and is writable.
- `-x file`: True if file exists and is executable.
- `-G file`: True if file exists and is owned by the effective group id.
- `-L file`: True if file exists and is a symbolic link.
- `-N file`: True if file exists and has been modified since it was last read.
- `-O file`: True if file exists and is owned by the effective user id.
- `-S file`: True if file exists and is a socket.
- `file1 -ef file2`: True if file1 and file2 refer to the same device and inode numbers.
- `file1 -nt file2`: True if file1 is newer (according to modification date) than file2, or if file1 exists and file2 does not.
- `file1 -ot file2`: True if file1 is older than file2, or if file2 exists and file1 does not.
- `-o optname`: True if the shell option optname is enabled. The list of options appears in the description of the -o option to the set builtin (see The Set Builtin).
- `-v varname`: True if the shell variable varname is set (has been assigned a value).
- `-R varname`: True if the shell variable varname is set and is a name reference.
- `-z string`: True if the length of string is zero.
- `-n string`: True if the length of string is non-zero.
- `string1 == string2`: True if the strings are equal.
- `string1 != string2`: True if the strings are not equal.
- `string1 < string2`: True if string1 sorts before string2 lexicographically.
- `string1 > string2`: True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically.
- `arg1 OP arg2`: `OP` is one of `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-gt`, or `-ge`. These arithmetic binary operators return true if `arg1` is equal to, not equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to `arg2`, respectively. `arg1` and `arg2` may be positive or negative integers.

For example, if we want to not run the loop for `snap001.txt`, we could do


```bash
for filename in $(cat snap2run.list)
do
    if [[ $filename != "snap001.txt" ]]
    then
        echo "Copying $filename ..." && cp $filename original-$filename && echo "$filename copied sucessfully"
    fi
done
```

    Copying snap002.txt ...
    snap002.txt copied sucessfully
