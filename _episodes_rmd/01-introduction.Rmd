teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is a command shell and why would I use one?"
- "How can I move around on my computer?"
- "How can I see what files and directories I have?"
- "How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?"
- "How can I create, copy, and delete files and directories?"
- "How can I edit files?"
- "How can I combine existing commands to do new things?"
- "How can I save and re-use commands?"
objectives:
- "Explain how the shell relates to the keyboard, the screen, the operating system, and users’ programs."
- "Explain when and why command-line interfaces should be used instead of graphical interfaces."
- "Explain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory."
- "Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa."
- "Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories."
- "Demonstrate the use of tab completion, and explain its advantages."
- "Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram."
- "Create files in that hierarchy using an editor or by copying and renaming existing files."
- "Delete, copy and move specified files and/or directories."
- "Redirect a command’s output to a file."
- "Process a file instead of keyboard input using redirection."
- "Construct command pipelines with two or more stages."
- "Explain what usually happens if a program or pipeline isn’t given any input to process."
- "Explain Unix’s ‘small pieces, loosely joined’ philosophy."
- "Write a shell script that runs a command or series of commands for a fixed set of files."
- "Run a shell script from the command line."
- "Write a shell script that operates on a set of files defined by the user on the command line."
- "Create pipelines that include shell scripts you, and others, have written."
keypoints:
- "A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs."
- "The shell’s main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines."
- "The shell’s main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be."
- "The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk."
- "Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders)."
- "Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree."
- "`cd path` changes the current working directory."
- "`ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory."
- "`pwd` prints the user’s current working directory."
- "`/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system."
- "A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location."
- "An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system."
- "Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\` on Windows."
- "`..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'."
- "Most files' names are something.extension. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file."
- "`cp old new` copies a file."
- "`mkdir path` creates a new directory."
- "`mv old new` moves (renames) a file or directory."
- "`rm path` removes (deletes) a file."
- "`*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`."
- "`?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`."
- "Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including `Ctrl-X`, `Control-X`, and `^X`."
- "The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it’s really gone."
- "Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano."
- "`cat` displays the contents of its inputs."
- "`head` displays the first 10 lines of its input."
- "`tail` displays the last 10 lines of its input."
- "`sort` sorts its inputs."
- "`wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs."
- "`command > file` redirects a command’s output to a file."
- "`first | second` is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second."
- "The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters)."
- "Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use."
- "`bash filename` runs the commands saved in a file."
- "`$@` refers to all of a shell script’s command-line arguments."
- "`$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc."
- "Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them."
- "Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands."
